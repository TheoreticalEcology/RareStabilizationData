Code and data used in publication and supplements, as well as some exploratory code not used in the final publication.

##Main files:

*[stabil_funtion](stabil_funtion.R) - The main analysis
*[null_function](null_function.R) - Shuffling to achieve the 'null' results
*[simulations](simulations.R) - Function used in the simulations in Appendix 3
*[immigration](immigration.R) - Function used in the immigration simulations in Appendix 4
*[supplementary_figures](supplementary_figures.R) - Production of figures in Appendix 5
*[stabil_function_nonlin](stabil_function_nonlin.R) - Function discussed in Appendix 6

Subfolders contain the data used for that taxonomic group. Files named with 'results' or 'pattern' are the overall results from this data.

The file stabil_function is the function used in the main analysis. Other files with similar names are other attempts, not used in the manuscript. Similarly for the null, simulation, and immigration functions, other files with similar names represent exploratory models not used in the manuscript.
